# Security Policy
## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please use the GitHub “Report a vulnerability” in the Security section to report a security issue.
Include a description, the steps to reproduce, the affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

Our vulnerability management team will respond within 3 working days of your report.
If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a Security Advisory. This project follows a 90-day disclosure timeline.

Where possible, we follow the [Guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure for open source software projects](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide).
